title: "How do we identify flash droughts? A case study in Central European Croplands"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/Alencar2022a
excerpt: 'The objective of this study was to compare, in a local/point (climatological station) scale, the functioning of six recently developed FD identification methods with data from four well-monitored experimental cropland sites in Central Europe, by assessing co- and misidentification of FD time series using similarity and synchronicity metrics. We selected two soil moisture-based methods and four indirect methods that used single or multiple climatic variables or indices for FD delineation. The methods were implemented in an R package and a Shiny app available to the public.'
