title: "Physically based model for gully simulation: application to the Brazilian semiarid region"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/Alencar2020
excerpt: 'In an effort to better understand soil loss in these systems, we studied small permanent gullies, which are a recurrent problem in the Brazilian northeastern semiarid region. The increase in sediment connectivity and the reduction of soil moisture, among other deleterious consequences, endanger this desertification-prone region and reduce its capacity to support life and economic activities. Thus, we propose a model to simulate gully-erosion dynamics, which is derived from the existing physically based models of Foster and Lane (1983) and Sidorchuk (1999)'
