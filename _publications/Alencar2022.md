title: "Entropy-based Model for Gully Erosion – A combination of probabilistic and deterministic components"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/Alencar2022
excerpt: 'In this paper, we propose a new gully erosion model that is based on the classical premise of net shear stress, i.e., hydraulic shear stress _minus_ critical (resistant) shear stress, to calculate detachment rates. To calculate hydraulic shear stress, we developed a new equation derived from the principle of minimum cross-entropy. The model
successfully estimated long-term erosion rates, its efficiency was 0.77, and it is recommended for catchments up to 8 ha. Therefore, the new model provides planners and  stakeholders with a tool to assess gully erosion, sediment
yield and geometry in most areas.'
