collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/Alencar2022
excerpt: 'We present a gully erosion model based on net shear stress and a new hydraulic shear stress equation derived from the principle of minimum cross-entropy; with an efficiency of 0.77, it is suitable for catchments up to 8 ha and supports assessments of erosion, sediment yield, and gully geometry.'
