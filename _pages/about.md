**Hi there, I'm Pedro Alencar**

I am a doctor with a double degree in Ecohydrology (Technische Universität Berlin) and Agricultural Engineering (Universidade Federal do Ceará). Currently, I'm a Postdoc researcher of the in the KI-Recover project, focusing on climate hazards to forest recovery, based at TU-Berlin, in Germany.

My research focuses on how climate extremes impact communities and ecosystems, and how the perception of climate extreme impacts can help us improve  identification, monitoring, and forecasting. Currently,  I'm dedicated to understanding this hazard-impact feedback loop for atmospheric blockings, droughts, flash droughts and dry spells in Brazil, Germany and USA. I'm also interested in erosion, sediment transport, and water management in  semiarid regions. To achieve all that, I use a large toolset that includes Information Theory, Remote Sensing, ML/Data Science, (eco)hydrological and crop modelling. 

On this page, you can find my latest publications, web tools, and news.
